Process a video of your finger to tell your heart rate

Guidelines for recording a video that should work:
- hold your finger right up against the camera of your phone, so the entire screen appears red
- record the video in a vertical orientation, with the left side brighter than the right side
- record about 30 seconds of video
- hold your finger very still! It helps to place your hand palm up on a tabletop and hold your phone on your finger
